# its-hmny.github.io

## My personal website, hosted at https://its-hmny.github.io

This single page website is my personal portfolio, it's meant to be really minimal and clean. Showcase my skills as Fullstack Developer and give the interested reader a lot of external references to my articles, repositories and social media.

I sprinkled in some 3D models because everything is better when there's an interactive 3D model on the side, also I wanted to experiment further with React Three Fiber (R3F) after [3D Cellular Automata](https://github.com/its-hmny/3D-Cellular-Automata).

## Installation

To install the dependencies and run the site locally, simply type in your terminal:

```bash
  yarn install  # NOTE: npm or pnpm can be used as well
  yarn dev      # Start a hot reloadable dev server
  yarn build    # Build the bundled website for deploy
```
