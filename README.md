# its-hmny.github.io
My first and personal website, hosted by GitHub pages https://its-hmny.github.io

It's all made with HTML, CSS and Javascript, note that these is the first time I work with each one of these.
The site itself it's really simple and lightweight, every resource is present locally and doesn't require any 
external library/link for the Javascript part.

The link in the description should be always working.

Note that the project is currently not optimized for mobile devices (support will be added later).

## Project structure
The body is divided in 3 basic sections (About me, Projects, Contacts). Each section has its own element inside.
In the About Me section there's a brief explanation of my previous experience and future personal target
as well as a download button for my Curriculum Vitae.

In the Projects section there's a table project populated with all my public project through the GitHub API and 
some Javascript code (the populateTable() function). The table will be always updated.

The Contacts section has, as you can imagine, some of mine social's profile links if a visitor ever want to keep in touch with me.
