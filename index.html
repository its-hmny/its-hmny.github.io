                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm a second year CS bachelor student at University of Bologna (UniBo).
                    I live and study in Bologna, Italy, but I would like to work abroad after in future, especially
                    in northern Europe. I love programming but I haven't found a specific sector that interest me most
                    but I would like to try Machine Learning and Neural Networks in future as well as deepen my
                    knowledge in Game programming/engineering. I'm looking forward to know more things both for my own career
                    and personal knowledge.
